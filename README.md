# AdvancedElevatorSystem
## Overview
> Advanced elevator system for Godot 4
> This is best suited for elevators in proceduarlly-generated worlds.

## How to use.
> You need to create up to three points (only one point is required - destination_point) for 1 floor.
> destination_point is required, and it is used for determining the floor.
> Up and down helper points are used for avoiding collisions with floor's objects, if the next floor is placed not over/under next floor (e.g. procedurally generated map)
> Then add elevator to your scene and configure parameters in the inspector.
